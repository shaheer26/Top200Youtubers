YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day. 
As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute. 
Youtube is very much used to influence, educate, free university (for me also) people (the users followers) in a particular way for a specific issue - 
which can impact the order in some ways.
